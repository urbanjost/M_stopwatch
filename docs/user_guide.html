<h3> Abstract:</h3>

<p>
<em>
   M_StopWatch is a Fortran 90 module for portable, easy-to-use measurement
   of execution time. It supports four clocks -- wall clock, CPU
   clock, user CPU clock and system CPU clock -- and returns all times
   in seconds. It provides a simple means of determining which clocks
   are available, and the precision of those clocks.
</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>
   M_StopWatch is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine calls
   that mimic the operation of a stop watch. M_StopWatch supports multiple
   watches, and provides the concept of watch groups to allow functions
   to operate on multiple watches simultaneously.
