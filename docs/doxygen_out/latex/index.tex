M\+\_\+stopwatch -\/ package for measuring cpu and wall clock execution time (L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+SE\+:PD)

M\+\_\+\+Stop\+Watch is a Fortran 90 module for measuring execution time of program segments. M\+\_\+\+Stop\+Watch is designed to be a portable, easy-\/to-\/ use means of measuring execution time. It supports the wall clock, C\+PU clock, and a breakdown of the C\+PU clock into user and system times. It returns all times in seconds. It provides a simple means of determining which clocks are available, and the precision of those clocks.

M\+\_\+\+Stop\+Watch is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine calls that mimic the operation of a stop watch. The primary routines are start\+\_\+watch, stop\+\_\+watch, reset\+\_\+watch, read\+\_\+watch, and print\+\_\+watch. M\+\_\+\+Stop\+Watch supports multiple watches, and provides the concept of watch groups to allow functions to operate on multiple watches simultaneously.
