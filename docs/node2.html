<p>
   M_StopWatch is a Fortran 90 module for measuring execution time of program
   segments. Measuring execution time is an important part of software
   development, especially for benchmarking and performance
   tuning. Unfortunately, Fortran has never supported the measurement of
   execution time, except through non-portable vendor extensions. Fortran
   90 introduced a subroutine for measuring wall clock time, but overlooked
   the more desirable CPU time. It is anticipated that the next Fortran
   standard, Fortran 95, will include a CPU time subroutine, but it does
   not break the time into ``user'' and ``system'' time like many CPU
   clock routines, and the standard still does not guarantee that either
   the wall clock or CPU clock routines will necessarily contain clock
   information. Moreover, direct use of the routines can be unwieldy,
   requiring multiple variables to keep track of returned values,
   differencing the returned values, and conversion of the values to
   useful units.

<p>
   M_StopWatch is designed to be a portable, easy-to-use means of measuring
   execution time. It supports the wall clock, CPU clock, a breakdown of
   the CPU clock into user and system times, and returns all times in
   seconds. It provides a simple means of determining which clocks are
   available, and the precision of those clocks. This version requires
   Fortran 95+ compilers.

<p>
   M_StopWatch is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine calls that
   mimic the operation of a stop watch. The primary routines are
  <b> start_watch</b>
  , <b> stop_watch</b>
  , <b> reset_watch</b>
  , <b> read_watch</b>
  and <b> print_watch</b>.
  M_StopWatch supports multiple watches, and provides the concept of
  watch groups to allow functions to operate on multiple watches
  simultaneously.
