<p>
   A watch is a variable declared to be of type <tt> watchtype</tt>
   . It can be passed to subroutines as an actual argument or through
   modules like any Fortran variable, but can only be operated on by
   the M_StopWatch subroutines. Watches must be created by subroutine <b>
   create_watch</b> before they are used. Attempting to use a watch that
   has not been created will generate a Fortran 90 error, from attempting
   to pass a pointer with undefined association status to the Fortran
   intrinsic function <b> associated</b> . Watches must be destroyed when
   no longer useful. For example, consider a local variable of type <tt>
   watchtype</tt> in a subroutine. Since the contents of a local variable
   are lost when the subroutine returns, the watch should be destroyed
   before returning to the calling program. Failure to destroy watches
   can lead to a memory leak.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li> <b> create_watch</b> -- creates a watch</li>
    <li> <b> destroy_watch</b> -- destroys a watch</li>
  </ul>

<p>
   Watches can optionally be given a name (up to 132 characters) through
   an optional argument, <i> name</i> , in <b> create_watch</b> . This
   name is used in error messages and <b> print_watch</b> to identify
   the watch in the printed output.
</p>


  <p>
   Different applications demand different definitions of ``time''. M_StopWatch
   supports four clocks in each watch, with each clock measuring a different
   concept of time. All of them measure time in seconds.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li> user -- the amount of CPU time used by the user's program</li>
    <li> sys -- the amount of CPU time used by the system in support of the user's program</li>
    <li> cpu -- the total CPU time, i.e., user+sys</li>
    <li> wall -- the wall clock time, i.e., elapsed real time</li>
  </ul>


<p>
   It is not required that all clocks be used. A watch can be created with
   any combination of the four clocks. You can also specify a set of <em>
   default clocks</em> to be used whenever the clocks are not explicitly
   determined.
</p>

<p>
   Since Fortran 90 does not contain an intrinsic function for CPU
   time, the implementation of the cpu, sys and user clocks is system
   dependent. Some implementations may support only cpu and wall, not
   user and sys. Some implementations may support only wall. Since the
   Fortran 90 standard requires the existence of a <b> system_clock</b>
   subroutine, but does not require that it provide clock information,
   it is possible that some implementations might not support wall. Clock
   availability can be determined by <b> inquiry_stopwatch</b> (see Section
   <a href="node9.html#opt"> 4.4</a> ). Unavailable clocks will automatically
   be removed from the set of default clocks, but if a clock that is not
   available is explicitly requested, a warning message will be generated.
</p>

<p>
   M_StopWatch supports multiple watches simultaneously. Often it is useful
   to perform the same operation on several watches. This is essential for
   correct operation of <b> pause_watch</b> and <b> end_pause_watch</b> and
   is convenient for procedures like <b> read_watch</b> , <b> print_watch</b>
   and <b> reset_watch</b> . To facilitate this, M_StopWatch supports the
   concept of <em> watch groups</em> . When calling a M_StopWatch subroutine,
   a watch group can be specified instead of a watch. The group is referenced
   by a variable of type <tt> watchgroup</tt> . Watch groups must be created
   before they are used.  Attempting to use a watch group that has not
   been created will generate a Fortran 90 error, from attempting to pass
   a pointer with undefined association status to the Fortran intrinsic
   function <b> associated</b> . Watch groups must be destroyed when no
   longer useful. The watches themselves are not destroyed, only the grouping
   of them. Failure to destroy watch groups can lead to a memory leak.
</p>

  <ul>
    <li> <b> create_watchgroup</b> -- creates a new watch group</li>
    <li> <b> destroy_watchgroup</b> -- destroys a watch group (but not the watches in the group)</li>
  </ul>


<p>
   Most M_StopWatch subroutines take <i> watch</i> as the first dummy argument,
   and accept several forms of <i> watch</i> . The forms are:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li> type (watchtype) watch -- a single watch</li>
    <li> type (watchtype) watch(:) -- an array of watches</li>
    <li> type (watchgroup) watch -- a watch group handle</li>
  </ul>

<p>
   In most M_StopWatch routines, an array of watches can be specified by an
   array constructor in the calling statement, for example:
</p>

<pre>
   type (watchtype) watch :: w1, w2, w3
   call print_watch( (/w1,w2,w3/) )
</pre>

<p>
   However, this can not be used in routines where <i> watch</i> has
   intent OUT or intent INOUT, because the array constructor is actually
   an expression, not a list of the variables. Currently this includes the
   routines <b> create_watch</b> and <b> destroy_watch</b>.
</p>


<p>
   Most M_StopWatch subroutines take <i> clock</i> as the (optional) second
   dummy argument to determine which of the four clocks will be affected by
   the action. <i> clock</i> can be one of the character strings 'user',
   'sys', 'cpu', or 'wall', or can be an array of such character strings
   to specify more than one clock. Since <i> clock</i> is always intent IN,
   an array of clock types can be built with an array constructor. However,
   note that Fortran 90 requires all character strings in such a construction
   to have the same length. Thus 'sys' and 'cpu' should be padded with a
   blank, as in:
</p>

<pre>
   call start_watch(watch, (/'user','sys ','cpu '/) )
</pre>

<p>
   If the optional argument <i> clock</i> is omitted, the current set
   of default clocks is used. The set of default clocks is set with <b>
   option_stopwatch</b> (see Section <a href="node9.html#opt"> 4.4</a> )
   and initially consists of all available clocks.
