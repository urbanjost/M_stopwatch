         M_stopwatch - package for measuring cpu and wall clock execution time (LICENSE:PD)

         M_StopWatch is a Fortran 90 module for measuring execution time
         of program segments.  M_StopWatch is designed to be a portable,
         easy-to- use means of measuring execution time.  It supports
         the wall clock, CPU clock, and a breakdown of the CPU clock
         into user and system times. It returns all times in seconds.
         It provides a simple means of determining which clocks are
         available, and the precision of those clocks.

         M_StopWatch is used by instrumenting your code with subroutine
         calls that mimic the operation of a stop watch.  The primary
         routines are start_watch, stop_watch, reset_watch, read_watch,
         and print_watch.  M_StopWatch supports multiple watches, and
         provides the concept of watch groups to allow functions to
         operate on multiple watches simultaneously.
